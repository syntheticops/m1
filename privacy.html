    <h1 class="page-title">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Important:</strong> lustrooms is an adult platform. By providing your email address and accessing this platform, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to handling your personal information with discretion.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
    <p>lustrooms ("we", "us", "our") operates the website located at lustrooms.com. We provide an adult entertainment platform featuring AI-generated virtual companions. <strong>No real persons are involved in, depicted, or represented by any content on our platform.</strong></p>
    <p>For privacy-related inquiries, contact us at: <a href="mailto:privacy@lustrooms.com">privacy@lustrooms.com</a></p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the minimum information necessary to operate our service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> — collected when you join our early bird waitlist or create an account.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong> — anonymized analytics data including pages visited, session duration, and general geographic region (country/city level), collected via Google Analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical data</strong> — browser type, device type, and IP address (anonymized where required by law).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect your name, payment details (handled by third-party processors), or any information that could identify you beyond what is necessary for service delivery.</p>
    <p>We do not use session recordings, heatmaps, or any behavioral profiling tools that capture individual interactions.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your email address is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sending you launch notifications and early access information you requested;</li>
      <li>Communicating your early bird discount and founding member benefits;</li>
      <li>Sending transactional communications related to your account (receipts, security alerts);</li>
      <li>Sending occasional platform updates — never more than necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your email address with any third party for marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Billing Discretion</h2>
    <p>We understand that discretion matters. All charges will appear on your billing statement under a neutral, non-descriptive company name that does not reference "lustrooms" or adult content. Your banking institution will never see the nature of the service you subscribed to.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services which may process limited data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Analytics / Google Tag Manager</strong> — anonymized traffic analytics. IP addresses are anonymized. You may opt out via <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's opt-out tool</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Payment processors</strong> — credit card and billing data is handled entirely by our PCI-DSS compliant payment processor. We never store your full card number.</li>
      <li><strong>Email delivery providers</strong> — used to send transactional emails. They receive only your email address and are bound by strict data processing agreements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
    <p>We use essential cookies (required for the site to function) and analytics cookies (Google Analytics). We do not use advertising cookies, retargeting cookies, or cross-site tracking cookies.</p>
    <p>You may disable cookies in your browser settings. Disabling analytics cookies will not affect your ability to use the platform.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your email address for as long as you remain on our mailing list or hold an active account. If you unsubscribe or request deletion, we will permanently remove your email from our systems within 30 days.</p>
    <p>Anonymized analytics data may be retained for up to 26 months for aggregate reporting.</p>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access</strong> — request a copy of the personal data we hold about you;</li>
      <li><strong>Correction</strong> — request correction of inaccurate data;</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion</strong> — request permanent deletion of your data ("right to be forgotten");</li>
      <li><strong>Portability</strong> — receive your data in a structured, machine-readable format;</li>
      <li><strong>Objection</strong> — object to processing of your data for direct marketing;</li>
      <li><strong>Restriction</strong> — request restriction of processing in certain circumstances.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To exercise any of these rights, email <a href="mailto:privacy@lustrooms.com">privacy@lustrooms.com</a>. We will respond within 30 days. California residents may additionally exercise their rights under the CCPA by the same process.</p>

    <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>lustrooms is strictly an adult platform. We do not knowingly collect or process personal data from anyone under the age of 18. If we become aware that a minor has provided personal information, we will delete it immediately. If you believe a minor has accessed our platform, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:privacy@lustrooms.com">privacy@lustrooms.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), hashed credentials, and access controls. No method of internet transmission is 100% secure; however, we take all commercially reasonable steps to protect your data.</p>
    <p>We will notify affected users and relevant authorities within 72 hours of becoming aware of a data breach that may affect your rights and freedoms, as required by applicable law.</p>

    <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Our services may be hosted on servers located in the United States or European Union. If you are located in the EU/EEA, your data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside the EEA. Such transfers are made with appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page and, where the changes are significant, notify you by email.</p>
