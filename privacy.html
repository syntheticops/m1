    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Important:</strong> Lustrooms is an adult platform. By providing your email address and accessing this platform, you confirm that you are at least 18 years of age. We take your privacy seriously and are committed to handling your personal information with full discretion and in compliance with applicable data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
    </div>

    <h2>1. Who We Are / Data Controller</h2>
    <p>Lustrooms ("we", "us", "our") operates the website located at lustrooms.com. We are the data controller responsible for your personal data. We provide an adult entertainment platform featuring exclusively AI-generated virtual companions. <strong>No real persons are involved in, depicted, or represented by any content on our platform.</strong></p>
    <p>For all privacy-related inquiries, contact us at: <a href="mailto:team@lustrooms.com">team@lustrooms.com</a></p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the minimum personal data necessary to operate our service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Email address</strong> — collected when you join our early bird waitlist or create an account.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage data</strong> — anonymized analytics data including pages visited, session duration, and general geographic region (country/city level), collected via Google Analytics.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical data</strong> — browser type, device type, operating system, and IP address (anonymized where required by applicable law).</li>
      <li><strong>Cookie data</strong> — consent preferences and session identifiers. See Section 7 below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect your full name, national identification numbers, payment card details (handled entirely by third-party processors), or any sensitive personal data as defined under Article 9 of the GDPR.</p>
    <p>We do not use session recordings, heatmaps, or behavioral profiling tools that capture individual interactions.</p>

    <h2>3. Lawful Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we process your personal data on the following legal bases under Article 6 of the GDPR:</p>

      <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a))</strong> — for sending marketing and launch notification emails. You may withdraw consent at any time by unsubscribing or emailing us.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract performance (Art. 6(1)(b))</strong> — for processing data necessary to fulfill your subscription, including transactional emails and account management.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f))</strong> — for anonymized analytics to improve our service, fraud prevention, and platform security. We have conducted a balancing test and determined these interests are not overridden by your rights.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation (Art. 6(1)(c))</strong> — where we are required to process data to comply with applicable laws.</li>

    <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or share your email address or any personal data with any third party for marketing purposes. Ever.</p>

    <h2>5. Billing Discretion</h2>
