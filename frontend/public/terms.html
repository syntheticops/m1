    <div class="notice warning">
      <strong>Adult Content Warning:</strong> Lustrooms contains sexually explicit material intended for adults only. By accessing or using Lustrooms, you confirm that: (1) you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, whichever is greater; (2) you are not accessing this site from a jurisdiction where adult content is prohibited by law; (3) you voluntarily choose to access this content for personal use; and (4) all content you will encounter consists exclusively of AI-generated synthetic imagery — no real persons are depicted.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing lustrooms.com, joining the waitlist, creating an account, or subscribing to our services, you ("User", "you") agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"), our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and all applicable laws and regulations. These Terms form a legally binding agreement between you and Lustrooms.</p>
    <p>If you do not agree to these Terms in their entirety, you must not access or use this platform.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on this page with an updated date. Where changes are material, we will notify you by email at least 14 days before they take effect. Continued use of the platform after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Age Verification and Eligibility</h2>
    <p><strong>You must be at least 18 years of age to access or use Lustrooms under any circumstances.</strong> By using this platform, you expressly represent, warrant, and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You are at least 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction if higher;</li>
      <li>You have the full legal right, capacity, and authority to enter into this agreement;</li>
      <li>You are not located in, and are not a national or resident of, any jurisdiction where accessing adult content is prohibited, restricted, or illegal;</li>
      <li>You are accessing this content voluntarily, for your own strictly personal and private use;</li>
      <li>You are not accessing this platform on behalf of any minor, in the presence of any minor, or at any location accessible to minors;</li>
      <li>Your access to and use of the platform is lawful in your jurisdiction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to request age verification documentation at any time. We reserve the right to immediately suspend or permanently terminate access to any account where age verification cannot be satisfactorily completed.</p>
    <p>If you provide false information regarding your age, you assume full legal responsibility for all consequences arising from such misrepresentation. We expressly disclaim all liability in such circumstances.</p>

    <h2>3. Nature of Content — AI-Generated Models</h2>
    <p><strong>All models, characters, personas, names, likenesses, and visual representations featured on Lustrooms are entirely AI-generated synthetic creations.</strong> By accessing this platform you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No real human beings are depicted, represented, employed, or involved in any content on this platform in any capacity whatsoever;</li>
      <li>All likenesses, voices, personas, and imagery are computer-generated and do not represent, depict, or portray any living or deceased person;</li>
      <li>No real individuals were photographed, filmed, recorded, or otherwise used to produce any content on this platform;</li>
      <li>Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental and wholly unintentional;</li>
      <li>All AI-generated models depicted are represented as adults aged 18 years or older.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. 18 U.S.C. § 2257 Compliance Statement</h2>
    <p>Lustrooms is exempt from the record-keeping requirements of 18 U.S.C. § 2257 and 28 C.F.R. Part 75 because all visual depictions displayed on this website are computer-generated images that do not involve the use of any actual human beings in their creation. No actual human being was used as a model, performer, or subject in the production of any visual content on this platform. The operator of this website is not the primary or secondary producer of any such content as those terms are defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2257.</p>

    <h2>5. Subscription and Payment Terms</h2>
    <p>Access to Lustrooms is provided on a subscription basis. By subscribing, you expressly agree to the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring basis (monthly, or as otherwise specified at checkout);</li>
      <li>You authorize us and our payment processor to automatically charge your payment method on each billing date;</li>
      <li>All charges will appear on your bank or card statement under a discreet, neutral billing descriptor that does not reference Lustrooms or adult content;</li>
      <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time via your account settings or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:team@lustrooms.com">team@lustrooms.com</a>;</li>
      <li>Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current paid billing period. You retain access until that date;</li>
      <li>No partial or pro-rata refunds are issued for unused time within a billing period, except where required by applicable mandatory law;</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to modify subscription pricing with a minimum of 30 days' written notice to affected subscribers. Your continued subscription after the price change takes effect constitutes acceptance of the new price;</li>
      <li>Failed payments may result in immediate suspension of access until payment is resolved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Early bird lifetime discount:</strong> Subscribers who lock in a founding member rate are guaranteed that rate for the continuous lifetime of their subscription. The lifetime rate is permanently and irrevocably forfeited upon any voluntary cancellation. Resubscription after cancellation will be billed at the then-current standard rate.</p>

    <h2>6. EU Right of Withdrawal — Waiver</h2>
    <p>If you are a consumer located in the European Union or European Economic Area, you ordinarily have a 14-day right of withdrawal from contracts for digital services under the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU).</p>
    <p><strong>By initiating your subscription and requesting immediate access to the platform, you expressly acknowledge and agree that: (a) performance of the digital service begins immediately upon subscription; and (b) you waive your right of withdrawal in accordance with Article 16(m) of the Consumer Rights Directive once performance has begun with your prior express consent and acknowledgement that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.</strong></p>
    <p>This waiver does not affect any rights you have under mandatory applicable consumer protection laws that cannot be contractually excluded.</p>

    <h2>7. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>All sales are final. We do not offer refunds for subscription fees already charged, except:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where required by applicable mandatory consumer protection law in your jurisdiction;</li>
      <li>Where we are unable to provide access to the platform for a continuous period exceeding 72 hours due to technical failure on our part;</li>
      <li>Where a charge was made in error (duplicate billing, unauthorized charge).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To request a refund on any of the above grounds, contact <a href="mailto:team@lustrooms.com">team@lustrooms.com</a> within 14 days of the charge.</p>

    <h2>8. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use Lustrooms only for lawful personal purposes consistent with these Terms. You must not, under any circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access or attempt to access the platform if you are under 18 years of age;</li>
      <li>Share, distribute, reproduce, upload, publish, or publicly display any content from Lustrooms without our express prior written permission;</li>

      <li>Content designed or intended to facilitate, encourage, or simulate real-world harm to any identifiable real individual.</li>
